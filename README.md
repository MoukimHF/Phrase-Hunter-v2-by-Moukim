 Phrase-Hunter-v2-by-Moukim

First Of all i changed a little bit something that was wrong with the project :
Before if a user selects the text on the phrase box ,the letters will appear clearly But now 
i changed a css style so text will go away of the box until the user clicks the right letter 
 text-indent: -9999px;  
  white-space: nowrap; 
  
  i used handleInteraction() for the visual keyboard clicks 
 and the handleInteraction1() to the physical keyboard clicks 
 buttons are disabled for both after one click.
 
 Besides i just added some little modifications on css dynamicly with js script after the user wins or loses the game
